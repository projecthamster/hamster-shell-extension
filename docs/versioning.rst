Versioning
===========

``hamster-shell-extension`` follows the `semantic versioning <http://semver.org>`_ scheme.
Each release is packaged and uploaded to the
`gnome extensions repository <https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/425/project-hamster-extension/>`_.
As this repository does not allow listing of multiple versions of the same
extension we will allways provide the latest stable release.  If you need a
different version, please check out the master branch on github. We provide
tags for all releases as well as convinient tarballs for manual installation.
